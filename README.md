# 👋 Hello, Hoomans!

A passionate developer who's constantly exploring the world of ERRORS. Welcome to my GitHub!

## 🚀 About Me

- 🐍 Python Developer
- 🌐 Web Developer
- 📚 Still in University (Learning never stops, right?)
- ☕ Excellent (or maybe the worst ) in Java

I love to tinker with code, build cool projects, and solve problems with technology. 

## 💼 What You'll Find Here

- A little bit of coding material
- Nothing
- Some informative things, maybe?
- And again, nothing 

## 🌟 Socials

- [Email](mailto:nitishyy@gmail.com)
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/532831020916146186)

## 🔥 Fun Facts

- I once tried to write a Python script to make coffee (it didn't go well).
- I do a very important job in my free time (sleep).

Today is the end of the world, so kindly do something good 🤟
